# The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl) CLI

Runs commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use `kubectl` to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

!!! warning "Version Compatibility"
    You must use a kubectl version that is within one minor version difference of your cluster. For example, a v1.23 client can communicate with v1.22, v1.23, and v1.24 control planes. Using the latest compatible version of kubectl helps avoid unforeseen issues.
